===============The Wesbury Lab Wikipedia corpus (2010)==========================

This corpus was created from a snapshot of all the articles in the
English part of the Wikipedia that was taken in April 2010. It was
processed, as described in detail below, to remove all links and
irrelevant material (navigation text, etc). The corpus is untagged, raw
text. It may be neccessary to process the corpus further to put the
corpus in a format that suits your needs.  

Processing: The snapshot was downloaded in April 2010 from the
Wikipedia dumper. It was then converted to text using the
WikiExtractor. The following pre-processing steps were also taken: All
documents that were less than 2000 characters long were omitted.

Corpus size: 990,248,478 words, over 2 million documents 
Data size: over 6Gb raw, 1.8Gb bzip compressed
